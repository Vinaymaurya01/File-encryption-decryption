# 🔐 File Encryption and Decryption using Java

A simple and secure Java-based application for **encrypting and decrypting files**. This project helps users protect sensitive information by converting readable files into encoded formats and restoring them back when needed.

Whether you're storing personal data, logs, or sensitive documents, this tool ensures your files remain confidential and tamper-proof.
This Java project allows users to encrypt or decrypt files using the AES encryption algorithm.

Features
Encrypt files using AES encryption
Decrypt files using AES decryption

- ✅ Encrypt any file (text, PDF, image, etc.)
- 🔓 Decrypt back to original form
- 🔐 Uses symmetric encryption (AES)
- 🧠 Simple and intuitive interface (console-based or GUI-based if added)
- 📁 Works with all file formats
- 💡 Easily extendable to add password-based protection or GUI
